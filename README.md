# Loan Approval Prediction Project Readme

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a loan approval prediction project. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on various features and historical loan data. This readme file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions on how to use and reproduce the results.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied by using machine learning techniques. This can be a critical task for financial institutions to automate and streamline their loan approval process, ensuring fairness and efficiency.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.
  - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Contains data preprocessing steps.
  - `Model_Training.ipynb`: Contains code for training the loan approval prediction model.
  - `Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Provides an in-depth analysis of the model's performance.

- **Data**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
  - `loan_data.csv`: Historical loan application data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd loan-approval-prediction
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory in the following order:
   - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Run this notebook to preprocess the data.
   - `Model_Training.ipynb`: Use this notebook to train the loan approval prediction model.
   - `Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Analyze the model's performance in this notebook.

## Data Preprocessing

The `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook contains the code and explanations for data preprocessing steps. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features. Make sure to run this notebook before proceeding to model training.

## Model Building

The `Model_Training.ipynb` notebook contains code for training the loan approval prediction model. You can experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters in this notebook to improve the model's performance.

## Model Evaluation

The `Model_Evaluation.ipynb` notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the model's performance. It includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Use this notebook to assess the model's suitability for the task.
